<h1> Travel and the many problems of it</h1>
<p> Flying is a quick way of moving around the world with lots of danger up in the air. 
with many plane crashes occuring but still being a very popular way of travelling far distances </p>
<p> Having people serve you food, toilets and being first class sometimes when going on you, can see why its such a popular option with a massive ammount people flying now their wouldn't be very many ways to make it overseas faster than a plane.</p>
       
<h2> Other forms of travel and their issues </h2>
<p> Other ways people travel are very efficient but at the same times they can get slowed down a lot cars first with 35,000 car crashes per year it seems theres issue with them whether that is whos driving them, what cars people drive because the most expensive cars will still blow up which is why its more practical to get a suv or a slower car its still good to have a car if you can drive properly because its insane how people drive that cant drive well which is why self driving cars are starting to become it.
Things with boats boats are great but some things we dont see are storms and massive rocks that come in contact and some of the issues with thankfully with cruiseliners and ferries its becoming harder to damage them but for boats that are that size they usually dont last to long </p>
<p> It`s a big buissness for a good reason no matter we think our bodies wouldnt be able to cope walking to other countries which is why we`ve revolutionised it and made it marketable even though flights might no be cheap at least you know it wouldnt be as bad as walking to another country </p>
       
<h3> The first forms of travel </h3>                                                                                                                                                             
<p> Some of the first forms of travel were horses boats and large ships with most of them being slow and unreliable with steam trains also being bad then but to this day they've kept up and people still go on horses and boats which shows how good they were and still are </p>
